# this is a list of things that should be done:

[x] test things out
    -- plot_data() not working
    -- load_data() not working

[x] move file debug into the sidebar
[ ] make it not a list of files and filenames but rather DFs and colnames 
[ ] get plot_data() working
[ ] copy from the .ipynb file that already has a working pipeline
